# S.O.N.I.A'S vision formation

This repository intends to help you to learn how to manage data (images) in order to make a usable dataset. It also explains how to train a simple AI detection model. 

This repository will be enhanced and it will give more details on vision AI models in the future.

## Instructions
First, look at the example in files: *code/example.py*, *code/dataloader.py* and *code/utils.py*.
Then do the first exercice, file: *code/exo1.py*.

## Important
You should NEVER put your data on a git repository, we did it with the archive aquarium.zip in order to make this tutorial more easy of use but it's a really bad practice that should never be done in a real project.
